		"ArticleContent": "<div class=\"body-jEK_kEtx body-op4L5uvo content-op4L5uvo\"><span><p class=\"\">The United States Federal Reserve Board announced Jan. 27 that it was issuing a policy statement on limitations on banks. The policy seeks to create a level playing field and limit regulatory arbitrage for state banks with deposit insurance, state banks without deposit insurance and national banks, which are overseen by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), by allowing them the same scope of permissible activities.</p><p class=\"\">The new policy will limit the activities of state banks by not allowing them to engage in activities not permitted by national banks unless state legislation allows it. In the Federal Register notice, the statement specifically discusses crypto at length. It stated:</p><div class=\"blockquote-R3wFjtCA\">“The Board has not identified any authority permitting national banks to hold most crypto-assets [...] As principal in any amount, and there is no federal statute or rule expressly permitting state banks to hold crypto-assets as principal. Therefore, the Board would presumptively prohibit state member banks from engaging in such activity under section 9(13) of the [Federal Reserve] Act.” </div><p class=\"\">The notice also said that state banks have proposed issuing “dollar tokens” — that is, stablecoins — and those banks now will be subject to OCC interpretative letters 1174 and 1179, as are national banks. It added:</p><div class=\"blockquote-R3wFjtCA\">“The Board generally believes that issuing tokens on open, public, and/or decentralized networks, or similar systems is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.” </div><p class=\"\">The statement was issued on the same day that the Fed rejected the application of Wyoming’s Custodia Bank for Federal Reserve System membership.</p><p class=\"\">The Fed beefed up scrutiny on banks engaging in crypto activities in August 2022, when it issued a letter requiring the banks it oversees to disclose plans that include crypto, with a reminder to ensure adequate risk management. The letter applied retrospectively to banks already active in crypto.</p><div class=\"container-Oc7Vf5KC\"><blockquote class=\"blockquote-Oc7Vf5KC\"><div class=\"header-Oc7Vf5KC\"><span class=\"profile-Oc7Vf5KC\"><div class=\"avatar-Oc7Vf5KC\"></div><div class=\"name-Oc7Vf5KC\">Federal Reserve</div><div class=\"username-Oc7Vf5KC\">@federalreserve</div></span><span class=\"logo-Oc7Vf5KC\"><svg height=\"28\" viewbox=\"0 0 28 28\" width=\"28\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10.28 22.26c7.55 0 11.68-6.26 11.68-11.67v-.53c.8-.58 1.49-1.3 2.04-2.13-.74.33-1.53.54-2.36.65.85-.5 1.5-1.32 1.8-2.28-.78.48-1.66.81-2.6 1a4.1 4.1 0 00-7 3.74c-3.4-.17-6.43-1.8-8.46-4.29a4.1 4.1 0 001.28 5.48c-.68-.02-1.3-.2-1.86-.5v.05a4.11 4.11 0 003.29 4.02 4 4 0 01-1.85.08 4.1 4.1 0 003.83 2.85A8.23 8.23 0 014 20.43a11.67 11.67 0 006.28 1.83z\" fill=\"#1DA1F2\"></path></svg></span></div><div class=\"description-Oc7Vf5KC\"><p class=\"\">@federalreserve issues policy statement to promote a level playing field for all banks with a federal supervisor, regardless of deposit insurance status: https://t.co/ms40zhoYUY</p></div><span class=\"date-Oc7Vf5KC\">Jan 27, 2023</span><span class=\"border-Oc7Vf5KC\"></span><span class=\"socials-Oc7Vf5KC\"></span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/federalreserve/status/1619010218876362755\"></a></blockquote><div></div></div></span></div>",

		"ProviderLogo": "https://s3.tradingview.com/news/logo/cointelegraph-en--theme-light.svg",
		"ProviderUrl": "https://cointelegraph.com",
		"ArticleContent": "<div class=\"body-jEK_kEtx body-op4L5uvo content-op4L5uvo\"><span><p class=\"\">Aptos’ APT reached a new all-time high of $20.39 after posting gains exceeding 400% since the start of 2023. While the rally could just be a pump-and-dump event due to the perception of weak fundamentals, increasing negative sentiment toward the token will likely fuel the prices in the short term.</p><p class=\"\">Let’s explore some of the factors that could be propelling the Aptos price rally.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>A rich history and strong investor backing</strong></p><p class=\"\">Aptos is a byproduct of Facebook’s attempt with the Libra blockchain, which regulators forcibly shut down. Two of Libra’s leadership team members, Mo Shaikh and Avery Ching, later found Aptos, a decentralized version of the abandoned blockchain project.</p><p class=\"\">The project is based on the Move programming language and introduces a new class of layer-1 blockchains that will compete against the likes of Solana and Cardano. The primary reasons behind the tailwinds for the APT token include investors’ hope for a technological breakthrough that could finally provide a scalable, secure, decentralized blockchain.</p><p class=\"\">Aptos raised $350 million in 2022, which included a $200 million seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz and a $150 million Series A funding round led by FTX Ventures and Jump Crypto. Later, Binance made a follow-on strategic investment to help boost the Aptos ecosystem.</p><p class=\"\">FTX Ventures’ prominence induces the risk of a sell-off from the defunct entity. In this regard, some investors might be reassured by the involvement of other venture capitalists like Multicoin Capital, Blocktower Capital and Coinbase Ventures. High-volume exchanges like Binance could also soften the blow dealt by FTX and Alameda Researc.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Steady ecosystem development</strong></p><p class=\"\">The Aptos blockchain was launched in October 2022 and is still in the nascent stages of ecosystem development.

It said the rejection would be something that it would “continue to litigate.”</p><p class=\"\">Custodia, formerly Avanti Bank, was founded by Cailtlin Long, a Wall Street veteran who worked for over twenty years at some of the biggest financial institutions in the United States, including Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and Salomon Brothers.</p><p class=\"\">After her exposure to Bitcoin and talking to Morgan Stanley’s CTO, Long moved back to her home state of Wyoming. She later identified a legal framework for crypto custody as pivotal to bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto. Having worked in the Wyoming legislature, Long oversaw the passage of thirteen crypto laws in two years.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Custody a Crucial Focus of Wyoming’s Laws</strong></p><p class=\"\">Long’s regulations went into the nitty-gritty of defining custody. It gave banks the green light for custodianship, and protected coders from lawsuits by declaring smart contract code free speech. The laws also defined the owner of a private key as the owner of any crypto under that key’s control. This definition was a radical departure from traditional banking, where a bank’s insolvency can mean a depositor’s funds are lost.</p><p class=\"\">New regulations also legalized a non-lending Special Purpose Depository Institution that did not need Federal Deposit Insurance to manage risk. Instead, these state-chartered institutions were compelled to hold sufficient capital to honor 100% of customer withdrawals.</p><p class=\"\">Many crypto projects and companies soon migrated to the Mountain West state, including Kraken, Ripple, and Solana.

The rubber stamp would have allowed the bank to enjoy the same public trust and reputation as the Fed.</p><p class=\"\">In its response, Custodia pointed out that a solvent business actively seeking federal regulation should have stood apart from “reckless speculators and grifters,” which brought some banks to their knees during the recent crypto meltdown. It did not directly respond to any measures under the state charter that would mitigate the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing brought up by the Federal Reserve.</p><p class=\"\">It is in the unfortunate position of being a novel non-lending institution trying to win Federal approval for membership in a group of most lending institutions governed by old laws. Unless Congress refreshes laws to include crypto custodians, Custodia could be fighting a losing battle.</p><p class=\"\">For Be[In]Crypto’s latest Bitcoin (BTC) analysis, click here.</p></span></div>",

The chair of the Treasury Select Committee, Harriett Baldwin MP, has called the UK crypto industry a “Wild West.”</p><p class=\"\">The comments came after 5 percent of crypto-asset firms (41 out of 300) who applied to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) failed to meet the minimum standards required for registration.</p><p class=\"\">There were a few cases where the financial regulator identified likely financial crimes or direct links to organized crime. The FCA passed suspected cases onto law enforcement agencies. </p><p class=\"\">“We are in the middle of an inquiry into crypto regulation, and these statistics have not disabused us of the impression that parts of this industry are a ‘Wild West,” said Harriet Baldwin MP, the committee chair.</p><p class=\"\">The Treasury Select committee is a cross-party forum responsible for scrutinizing the UK’s finances. Its remit includes examining the work of public bodies, including the Bank of England and the FCA.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>A Terrible Look for the UK Crypto Industry</strong></p><p class=\"\">From Jan 10, 2020, the government implemented standards for terrorist financing and money laundering activity that crypto firms were required to meet. Making them subject to the same standards as traditional financial markets. The Treasury revealed that many crypto firms did not meet these standards. Only 5% passed the first attempt.</p><p class=\"\">The regulator reported that 73% of applications were withdrawn or failed on the first attempt. The highest rate they have ever seen. A statistic that paints the industry in a negative light. </p><p class=\"\">Firms who did not pass the initial In a letter to the committee chair, Sarah Pritchard, Executive Director of Markets at the FCA, said: </p><div class=\"blockquote-R3wFjtCA\"> <p class=\"\">“As mentioned in the session, just because a firm is not able to satisfy us that it meets the standards we would expect in terms of its anti-money laundering systems and controls, it does not necessarily follow that there is criminal activity. Some firms who withdraw from registration will re-submit their applications once they believe they can meet our standards.”</p> </div><p class=\"\"><strong>Failed Applicants Can Reapply</strong></p><p class=\"\">“This worrying statistic shows why the FCA must continue to take a robust stance on crypto-asset firms and exchanges that look to operate within the UK,” said Martin Cheek, managing director of anti-money laundering software platform SmartSearch.</p><p class=\"\">“The cryptocurrency industry must meet the compliance requirements of the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive by integrating digital compliance solutions with their own technology. As well as meeting the FCA’s requirements, this would certainly give crypto investors greater peace of mind.</p><p class=\"\">“Cryptocurrency can provide a vehicle for money laundering, and a front for some of the world’s worst crimes – people trafficking, tax dodging, sanctions evasion, and international corruption and its victims are often the poorest and most vulnerable in society.”</p><p class=\"\">The news comes as the new UK Prime Minister tries to make the UK a global crypto hub. This week, the former Finance Minister, Phillip Hammond, said the country was slipping behind other countries. In recent days, Hammond has become the chair of Mayfair-based crypto custodian Copper.</p><p class=\"\">“The UK needs to be leading in this area post-Brexit,” Hammond said. “It’s allowed itself to slip behind. Switzerland is further ahead. The EU is also moving faster. There has to be appetite to take some measured risk.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Warning Signs Are Flashing for the UK Crypto Industry</strong></p><p class=\"\">This is the latest round of bad news for the UK crypto industry. Over the last few months, the sector has seen repeated blows to its ambitions. Last month, the incoming head of the FCA, Ashley Alder, made damning comments about crypto.</p><p class=\"\">He told the Treasury Select Committee that crypto platforms were “deliberately evasive” and a method by which money laundering happens at size.” </p></span></div>",

Approval from the Senate and the House of Representatives would do. If approved, the bill would enable crypto payments at restaurants and vending machines within Capitol buildings. It also encourages gift shops in the Capitol area to accept cryptocurrency as payment from customers.

A financial disclosure from early 2022 shows that he bought between $15,000 and $50,000 worth of BTC. At the time Bitcoin was trading at $36,000. At the Texas Blockchain Summit held in November 2022, the senator publicly supported Bitcoin mining. He presented his home state as the optimal region to facilitate Bitcoin mining with an abundant energy supply and substantial investment. </p></span></div>",

It allows state agencies to enter into “agreements with persons to provide the acceptance, by offices of the state, of cryptocurrency as a means of payment” for various types of fees, including “fines, civil penalties, rent, rates, taxes, fees, charges, revenue, financial obligations or other amounts, including penalties, special assessments and interest, owed to state agencies.” </p><p class=\"\">The bill does not obligate state agencies to accept crypto as payment, but it does clarify that state agencies can legally agree to accept such payments and that these agreements should be enforced by the courts.</p><p class=\"\">The bill defines “cryptocurrency” as “any form of digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency [...] including but not limited to, bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and bitcoin cash.”</p><p class=\"\">Depending on how this definition is interpreted, it may or may not include stablecoins like USD Coin (<a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/USDCUSD/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">USDC</a>) and Tether (<a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/USDTUSD/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">USDT</a>). On the one hand, the supply of stablecoins is usually regulated by the issuer instead of by cryptography. On the other hand, the bill does recognize that some cryptocurrencies have an “issuer,” and it provides that agencies can charge the payor an extra fee if such a fee is charged by the cryptocurrency’s issuer.</p><p class=\"\">To become law, the bill will need to be passed by the New York Assembly and Senate, as well as signed into law by the state's Governor, Kathy Hochul.</p><p class=\"\">The New York state government is often seen as hostile to cryptocurrency. In November 2022, New York became the first state to pass a bill that banned nearly all cryptocurrency mining. It also has been criticized for the restrictive “BitLicense” it requires all crypto exchanges to acquire. In April 2022, the mayor of New York argued that the BitLicense law should be repealed.</p></span></div>",

During periods of extreme volatility, it’s easy to become disheartened when trades don’t go your way. It’s also easy to become overconfident when you get lucky, falsely attributing it to your trading strategy — when, in reality, the price often rose or fell for reasons other than you assumed.</p><p class=\"\">Despite the uncertainty, there are sometimes still strategies you can use to trade certain tokens successfully. Ether (<a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ETH</a>) is arguably where you might be able to succeed this year. Here are three tips that might help.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Understand what actually affects ETH price movements</strong></p><p class=\"\">There are many ways to analyze the price of a given cryptocurrency, and different price valuations will be given depending on the model used and how much weight is given to a specific set of conditions. </p><p class=\"\">But incorrect weighting can produce erroneous conclusions. For instance, a cryptocurrency can generate positive buy signals across the board, but other factors can send the entire market tanking.</p><div class=\"container-Oc7Vf5KC\"><blockquote class=\"blockquote-Oc7Vf5KC\"><div class=\"header-Oc7Vf5KC\"><span class=\"profile-Oc7Vf5KC\"><div class=\"avatar-Oc7Vf5KC\"></div><div class=\"name-Oc7Vf5KC\">Pentoshi</div><div class=\"username-Oc7Vf5KC\">@Pentosh1</div></span><span class=\"logo-Oc7Vf5KC\"><svg height=\"28\" viewbox=\"0 0 28 28\" width=\"28\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10.28 22.26c7.55 0 11.68-6.26 11.68-11.67v-.53c.8-.58 1.49-1.3 2.04-2.13-.74.33-1.53.54-2.36.65.85-.5 1.5-1.32 1.8-2.28-.78.48-1.66.81-2.6 1a4.1 4.1 0 00-7 3.74c-3.4-.17-6.43-1.8-8.46-4.29a4.1 4.1 0 001.28 5.48c-.68-.02-1.3-.2-1.86-.5v.05a4.11 4.11 0 003.29 4.02 4 4 0 01-1.85.08 4.1 4.1 0 003.83 2.85A8.23 8.23 0 014 20.43a11.67 11.67 0 006.28 1.83z\" fill=\"#1DA1F2\"></path></svg></span></div><div class=\"description-Oc7Vf5KC\"><p class=\"\">New daily reminder: $ETH will at some point clean up this $1072 area.

In fact, bearish traders ran the price into the ground. </p><p class=\"\">The crypto market also tends to correlate heavily with Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BTC</a>), which is traded by a lot of institutional and hedge fund money that is tied to interest rates and traditional financial markets. ETH currently holds a 0.9 correlation with Bitcoin.</p><p class=\"\">Leading up to May 2021 and November 2021, ETH experienced significant price increases. This was attributed to announcements from big firms, such as the decision of the European Investment Bank to offer a two-year bond on the Ethereum blockchain. Visa also announced plans to transact in USD Coin (<a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/USDCUSD/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">USDC</a>) over Ethereum. </p><p class=\"\">A summary of the factors that affect the price of Ether is that it will be affected most heavily by Bitcoin’s price movement, interest rate decisions, institutional investment and macroeconomic conditions that discourage investment.</p><p class=\"\">Fundamental blockchain indicators, however, can strongly point toward medium-term appreciation, perhaps over one to three years. Based on these indicators, Ethereum is a very powerful blockchain with a thriving ecosystem set for growth. </p><p class=\"\"><strong>Anticipate the seasonality </strong></p><p class=\"\">Like other cryptocurrencies, ETH has specific months where it performs well, and others where it performs poorly. It performs the worst in September, June and March, meaning those may be good times to become a buyer.</p><p class=\"\">In contrast, it performs well in February, April and May. This is a time for traders to issue sell orders, while buy-and-hold investors might simply avoid these months in terms of investment (though other criteria should also be taken into account). </p><p class=\"\">While there are claims that certain hours of the day are more lucrative than others for investment, studies have shown this is not the case, at least where Bitcoin is concerned. The same applies to days of the week.</p><span class=\"container-Kl_TzTII\"><figure><div class=\"preview-xWiEHZgw fixedHeight-xWiEHZgw preview-Kl_TzTII\" style=\"max-height:600px;--news-image-aspect-ratio:0.47671994440583737\"><picture class=\"picture-xWiEHZgw\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/cointelegraph:54a8c9442094b-1b8f31b57dc60aaae8fca395d9de3864-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img class=\"image-xWiEHZgw image-Kl_TzTII\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/cointelegraph:54a8c9442094b-1b8f31b57dc60aaae8fca395d9de3864-resized.jpeg\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-Kl_TzTII\"><span class=\"copyright-Kl_TzTII\">Cointelegraph</span></figcaption></figure></span><p class=\"\">Even if there are certain days or times to trade Ethereum, only active traders will be able to gauge this information correctly and withstand the increased fees of more regular trades. More realistically, seasonality can be applied on a monthly and perhaps quarterly basis for most. </p><p class=\"\">Seasonality is something to keep in mind as there are definite monthly trends. </p><p class=\"\"><strong>Consider dollar-cost-averaging</strong></p><p class=\"\">A popular and research-backed means to trade Ether (and any other asset) is dollar-cost-averaging (DCA), a technique first popularized by Benjamin Graham and applied to the equity market. </p><p class=\"\">DCA is a means of investing smaller amounts at specific intervals. You could, for instance, invest a specific amount at the start of each month. This ensures that you get all the highs and lows (at least on a month-to-month basis), smoothing out volatility. </p><p class=\"\">It’s a great way for newcomers to enter the market because it requires no technical expertise or time investment. You don’t have to conduct research or learn statistical models or correlations (though you can obviously do this on the side).</p><p class=\"\">DCA can also be a great baseline for more creative investments, providing a stable foundation. For example, you can combine it with seasonality, choosing the three to four months where Ether has historically been priced on the low end. </p><p class=\"\">At the very least, DCA can help you to avoid the volatility of the cryptocurrency markets with investment spread out across time. Holding on to your investment is as important as making profits, a fact often missed in an industry often overtaken with hype and profits. </p><p class=\"\"><strong>Other points to keep in mind</strong></p><p class=\"\">The upcoming Ethereum Shanghai upgrade in March will allow users to withdraw staked ETH, valued at more than $20 billion as of mid-January, though it isn’t clear whether investors will capitalize on the opportunity — which would be bearish — or continue holding their ETH, which would be bullish.</p><p class=\"\">Fundamental indicators with regard to a given blockchain — active addresses, forks, functional upgrades, node diversification, speed, etc. — are often not factored into the price on a short time horizon. Ethereum’s Merge, for instance, reduced waste by 99.9% but did nothing for the price, being overshadowed by wider economic factors. </p><p class=\"\">But these are certainly useful indicators on a longer time horizon. The work that has been done to enhance the Ethereum blockchain and ecosystem will, eventually, be reflected in its price. </p><p class=\"\">In this regard, Ether is a wonderful investment opportunity for late 2023 and perhaps 2024, given recent innovations.</p><p class=\"\">It is, in many ways, a perfect token for a patient investor. </p><strong>Daniel O’Keeffe</strong> worked for three years as a compliance analyst for JPMorgan and State Street.

If the pilot succeeds, the goal is to enable Lightning payments for all Clover merchants.</p><p class=\"\">According to Mallers, any application with Lightning capability, from CashApp to a node on the Tor anonymizing network, would be able to send money to the merchant’s Clover terminal.</p><p class=\"\">The Lightning Network is a layer two Bitcoin solution that allows quick funds transfers between two nodes via a ‘payment channel.’ These micropayments incur very low fees without being published to the layer one Bitcoin network.</p><p class=\"\">Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor said that MicroStrategy, the enterprise software company he founded in 1989, would develop enterprise architecture to enable e-commerce companies to receive payments denominated in Satoshis or one-hundred-millionths of a Bitcoin using the Lightning Network.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Strike’s History With the Lightning Network</strong></p><p class=\"\">Initially an El Salvador-based private entrepreneur working to fix the country’s expensive remittance system with Bitcoin, Mallers shot to prominence after President Nayib Bukele asked his advice on making Bitcoin legal tender in the country. He soon became a keynote speaker at major Bitcoin conferences.</p><p class=\"\">Through Mallers’ Strike payments app, El Salvador citizens could receive remittances from the U.S. without needing to handle Bitcoin directly. The app could convert fiat deposits to Bitcoin and send them to a Strike partner in the destination country. Strike would then convert the Bitcoin into the recipient’s fiat currency and credit the recipient’s Strike account. Lightning’s low fees meant remittances could be free instead of costing up to half the transferred amount.</p><p class=\"\">Strike also integrated its Application Programming interface into Twitter to enable content creators to receive tips. Twitter has since discontinued the service after poor user interest.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Fintechs Can Supercharge User Experience with Lightning Network</strong></p><p class=\"\">The ability of Clover merchants to receive payments via the Lightning Network can supercharge the user experience for customers of so-called fintech firms that have boomed in recent years. Almost $140 billion was invested in the fintech sector between 2012 and 2022. One source predicts that the digital wallet user base will reach 125 million by 2025.</p><p class=\"\">Fintechs charge a fee for aggregating a customer’s transaction and passing them on to a payment processor or bank.</p><p class=\"\">More user-focused, these companies create slick apps that appeal to a younger clientele demanding fast, affordable payments. The Lightning Network’s speed and low fees can finally free fintechs from the shackles of legacy banking. Fintechs can then drive Bitcoin payments in 2023.</p><p class=\"\">For Be[In]Crypto’s latest Bitcoin (BTC) analysis, click here.</p></span></div>",

After getting caught up in the Terra fiasco, which resulted in one of the most prolific asset death spirals of all time, the company managed to avoid bankruptcy after receiving a $400 million lifeline in July 2022. The problem? Its lender was FTX US, and we all know what happened next.</p><p class=\"\">Although BlockFi has attempted to separate itself from Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraud in the aftermath of FTX’s collapse, its secret financials tell a different story.</p><p class=\"\">This week’s Crypto Biz delves into BlockFi’s uncensored financials, the likelihood of “Celsius token” ever seeing the light of day and the latest high-profile funding deal in blockchain. </p><p class=\"\"><strong>Breaking: BlockFi uncensored financials reportedly shows $1.2B FTX exposure</strong></p><p class=\"\">Just how bad are BlockFi’s financials? For starters, the bankrupt crypto lending firm reportedly has $1.2 billion in assets tied up in Sam Bankman-Fried’s failed companies — FTX and Alameda Research, to be specific. According to CNBC, BlockFi made these details public by accident, adding insult to injury. Nevertheless, the documents show that the company had $315.9 million worth of assets linked to FTX and $831.3 million in loans to Alameda as of Jan. 14. Although BlockFi has attempted to separate itself from SBF’s companies, it looks like it’ll continue to circle the same drain as FTX and Alameda. </p><p class=\"\"><strong>BlockFi to sell $160M in Bitcoin miner-backed loans: Report</strong></p><p class=\"\">BlockFi is reportedly looking to sell $160 million in loans backed by 68,000 Bitcoin (BTC) miners as part of its bankruptcy proceedings. That sounds like a good strategy to raise liquid funds, right? Unfortunately, some of these loans have already defaulted and are likely undercollateralized following Bitcoin’s year-long bear market. A legal expert interviewed by Cointelegraph cautioned that the loans are probably “not worth their paper value anymore.” Let’s hope for BlockFi’s sake that the value of the mining equipment used in the collateral isn’t worth less than the value of the loans. </p><p class=\"\"><strong>New ‘Celsius token’ may be used to repay creditors: Report</strong></p><p class=\"\">Months before FTX collapsed, crypto lender Celsius filed for bankruptcy after its degen crypto portfolio failed to survive the bear market. Billions in customer deposits now hang in the balance as the company looks for an optimal reorganization strategy. This week, it was reported that Celsius was considering issuing its own token to repay creditors. Of course, this means relaunching its platform. Apparently, Celsius wants to wrap this up in a new publicly-traded company that is “properly licensed.” I’m not sure Alex Mashinsky will ever succeed in crypto again, but here’s hoping Celsius creditors get something in return for trusting him in the first place. </p><div class=\"container-Oc7Vf5KC\"><blockquote class=\"blockquote-Oc7Vf5KC\"><div class=\"header-Oc7Vf5KC\"><span class=\"profile-Oc7Vf5KC\"><div class=\"avatar-Oc7Vf5KC\"></div><div class=\"name-Oc7Vf5KC\">CelsiusFactsNumbers</div><div class=\"username-Oc7Vf5KC\">@CelsiusFacts</div></span><span class=\"logo-Oc7Vf5KC\"><svg height=\"28\" viewbox=\"0 0 28 28\" width=\"28\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10.28 22.26c7.55 0 11.68-6.26 11.68-11.67v-.53c.8-.58 1.49-1.3 2.04-2.13-.74.33-1.53.54-2.36.65.85-.5 1.5-1.32 1.8-2.28-.78.48-1.66.81-2.6 1a4.1 4.1 0 00-7 3.74c-3.4-.17-6.43-1.8-8.46-4.29a4.1 4.1 0 001.28 5.48c-.68-.02-1.3-.2-1.86-.5v.05a4.11 4.11 0 003.29 4.02 4 4 0 01-1.85.08 4.1 4.1 0 003.83 2.85A8.23 8.23 0 014 20.43a11.67 11.67 0 006.28 1.83z\" fill=\"#1DA1F2\"></path></svg></span></div><div class=\"description-Oc7Vf5KC\"><p class=\"\">BREAKING NEWS </p><p class=\"\">- #CelsiusNetwork is looking at having a stratefied recovery smaller holders bellow 5k might get all assets to leave.</p><p class=\"\">- Larger holders will get a debt token that seems to represent all the value, so you can sell if you dont believe in the company or recovery.</p></div><span class=\"date-Oc7Vf5KC\">Jan 24, 2023</span><span class=\"border-Oc7Vf5KC\"></span><span class=\"socials-Oc7Vf5KC\"></span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CelsiusFacts/status/1617919538628288515\"></a></blockquote><div></div></div><p class=\"\"><strong>Injective launches $150M ecosystem fund to boost DeFi, Cosmos adoption</strong></p><p class=\"\">If you’re looking for a silver lining in crypto this week, take solace in the fact that companies are once again raising hundreds of millions in venture capital (VC). Chief among them is Injective, the layer-1 blockchain protocol built on Cosmos SDK. This week, Injective announced a $150 million ecosystem fund backed by Pantera Capital, Kraken Ventures, Jump Crypto, KuCoin Ventures, Delphi Labs and others. The fund will support developers building on the Cosmos network — specifically infrastructure solutions, trading platforms and proof-of-stake technology. Will crypto VC rebound strongly in 2023?

In this week’s Market Report, I sat down with fellow analysts Marcel Pechman and Joe Hall to discuss whether the current pump is sustainable.

The relevant indicator here is the “all exchanges netflow,” which measures the net amount of Bitcoin exiting or entering into the wallets of all centralized exchanges. The metric’s value is calculated by taking the difference between the inflows (the coins going in) and the outflows (the coins moving out).</p><p class=\"\">When the indicator has a positive value, the inflows overwhelm the outflows, and a net number of coins are deposited to exchanges. As one of the main reasons investors deposit to exchanges is for selling purposes, this trend can have bearish implications for the price of the crypto.</p><p class=\"\">On the other hand, negative values imply that a net amount of supply is currently being pulled off these platforms. Generally, holders withdraw their coins from exchanges to hold onto them for extended periods in personal wallets. Thus, such metric values can signal that investors are accumulating at the moment, which may have a bullish impact on the price.</p><p class=\"\">Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin all exchange’s netflow over the last few months:</p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-Kl_TzTII\"><figure><div class=\"preview-xWiEHZgw fixedHeight-xWiEHZgw preview-Kl_TzTII\" style=\"max-height:600px;--news-image-aspect-ratio:0.54609375\"><picture class=\"picture-xWiEHZgw\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:f792a663c094b-988e05f5f01eeaa5934f8698617cae43-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Bitcoin Exchange Netflow\" class=\"image-xWiEHZgw image-Kl_TzTII\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:f792a663c094b-988e05f5f01eeaa5934f8698617cae43-resized.jpeg\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-Kl_TzTII\"><span class=\"copyright-Kl_TzTII\">NewsBTC</span></figcaption></figure></span></p><p class=\"\">As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange netflow recorded a deep negative spike during the past day. This outflow amounted to around 7,000 BTC, leaving the wallets of these platforms the largest value the metric has seen since the FTX crash back in November of last year.</p><p class=\"\">From the chart, it’s apparent that the aftermath of FTX’s collapse saw some substantial outflow values. The reason behind that is that a known exchange like FTX going belly up instilled fear among investors and made them more aware of the risks of keeping their coins in centralized platforms.</p><p class=\"\">Naturally, these holders fled exchanges in masses (causing the netflow to plunge into red values) so that they could store their Bitcoin in offsite wallets, the keys they own.</p><p class=\"\">Interestingly, the latest negative netflow spike was recorded while Bitcoin has been observing a sharp rally. Usually, inflows are more commonly seen in periods like now, as investors rush to take some profits.</p><p class=\"\">Thus, instead of making these large outflows, investors are showing signs that they are bullish on Bitcoin in the long term and feel that the current rally has more to offer still.</p><p class=\"\">That would be only if these investors made the withdrawals with accumulation in mind. In the scenario that they transferred out these coins for selling through over-the-counter (OTC) deals instead, Bitcoin could instead feel a bearish impulse.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>BTC Price</strong></p><p class=\"\">At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $23,100, up 8% in the last week.</p></span></div>",

Wybo Wiersma was accused of stealing over £2.1 million ($2.6 million) of the cryptocurrency IOTA between Jan. 17 and April 30, 2018. Following his guilty plea, Judge Michael Gledhill sentenced Wiersma to four years and six months’ imprisonment.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Wiersma Defrauded 99 Victims</strong></p><p class=\"\">While studying as a doctoral student at Oxford, Wiersma created a fraudulent website that he used to surreptitiously gain access to others’ crypto. The website purportedly created a “randomly-generated” 81-character “string” wallet password users needed to hold the crypto IOTA.</p><p class=\"\">However, the string of numbers had actually already been created by Wiersma, meaning he had access to each one. Between the dates mentioned above, the computer expert proceeded to deplete the IOTA accounts of 99 victims. During the time of the theft, the total amount stolen was worth roughly £2.1 million.</p><p class=\"\">After authorities arrested Wiersma in Jan. 2019, he spent more than two years on remand awaiting trial. The case had been delayed due to the difficulty in finding the relevant IT expert to explain the case to the jury. Wiersma has already served the equivalent of a prison sentence of at least four years.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>FBI Busts Hive</strong></p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, as U.K. authorities attend to a smaller case of crypto crime, their U.S. counterparts have some bigger fish to fry. The U.S. Department of Justice announced a disruption campaign it has been waging against the Hive ransomware group.</p><p class=\"\">In July last year, the FBI managed to infiltrate Hive’s computer networks and captured its decryption keys. This saved victims from having to pay $130 million in ransoms. Since then, the FBI has distributed over 300 decryption keys to Hive victims who were under attack, and over 1,000 keys to previous Hive victims. </p><p class=\"\">The authorities also seized control of the servers and websites that Hive used to communicate with its members. This seizure has effectively disrupted Hive’s ability to attack and extort victims. The disruption comes as revenues from ransomware attacks have diminished over the past year.</p></span></div>",

Custodia, headed by Caitlin Long, applied for the master account in 2020 and sued the Fed over the long delay in considering the application in June. </p><p class=\"\">The Fed gave the bank 72 hours to withdraw its application, Custodia said in a statement. It added, “Custodia actively sought federal regulation, going above and beyond all requirements that apply to traditional banks.”</p><p class=\"\">The Fed only issued guidelines for granting master accounts in August, when it became clear that digital asset banks could have a difficult time receiving an account. “Institutions that engage in novel activities and for which authorities are still developing appropriate supervisory and regulatory frameworks would undergo a more extensive review,” the Fed said in a statement at the time. </p><p class=\"\">BNY Mellon bank was approved by the Fed to provide crypto custody services in October, making it the first major U.S. bank to offer custody of digital assets and traditional investments on the same platform. Custodia Bank was founded in Wyoming in 2020, taking advantage of the crypto-friendly state’s 2019 opt-in custody rules for “blockchain banks.” </p></span></div>",

Year-on-year, the core PCE rose 4.4% in Dec. 2022, down from 4.7% in Nov. 2022. Personal income, which measures how much people earn, rose 0.2%, while personal savings also increased. </p><p class=\"\"><strong>Bitcoin 2023 Rally Mostly Unperturbed by Personal Consumption Expenditure</strong></p><p class=\"\">Crypto markets struggled to interpret the data, with Bitcoin rising to almost $23,000 after the data was released before falling back to around $22,850. At press time, the world’s largest crypto by market capitalization had stabilized around $23,040. Ethereum also saw a brief rally to just under $1,580, before it declined to around $1,568. It eventually stabilized higher at $1,584.</p><p class=\"\">Bitcoin has mostly held onto gains of 40% since the start of 2023, fueled partly by bullish trading in Bitcoin options, according to Pierino Ursone of the crypto derivatives exchange Deribit.

But the tendency might be temporary as markets slide into the weekend.SHIB whales no longer interested</p><p class=\"\">The enormous buying power that existed on the market at the beginning of the reversal rally is gone now, and the majority of Shiba Inu whales are no longer interested in supporting the rally. However, the inability or reluctance of whales to push the token further might be tied to the necessity of a temporary correction that would cool off SHIB and the market in general. Source: TradingView</p><p class=\"\">Yesterday, we saw an enormous drop in the amount of Shiba Inu tokens burned on the network. Such a severe drop could be considered an indicator of descending network activity that is not doing any favors to SHIB. Luckily, the burn rate and the overall network activity of Shiba Inu is seeing a recovery as the burn rate now reaches values we usually see when the network functions as usual.</p><p class=\"\">From a technical perspective, SHIB was unable to break through the prolonged downtrend and reversed at the three-month trendline. If the same tendency on the market prevails, the meme token will return to the descending movement channel and lose all of its gains since the beginning of the reversal on the market.Solana's pivotal point</p><p class=\"\">In one of our previous reviews, we highlighted the importance of the local trendline support for Solana that investors use as a guideline for rebounds for SOL. Unfortunately, Solana was unable to exit the narrow trading channel and must now get some support from investors in order to proceed further.</p><p class=\"\">However, indicators like the relative strength index, volume profiles and volatility suggest that SOL will fall below the local trendline and enter a downtrend, even though a comeback would be possible in the future. According to analysts like Chris Burniske, a midterm bear market is not what Solana investors anticipate.XRP's weird state</p><p class=\"\">The last thing you would expect from XRP, which has not been showing any outstanding performance on the market, is the \"over bought\" signal flashing on RSI as the indicator suggests that the cryptocurrency has very limited room to grow.</p><p class=\"\">Since the beginning of a market-wide reversal, XRP gained around 17% to its value, which is not the best performance on the market, not even in the top 10. However, investors have already stopped pumping the asset with funds, which could be the main reason behind the 3% reversal of XRP from the local high.</p><p class=\"\">At press time, XRP is trading at $0.4 and consolidating around the 200-day moving average. It has not been able to break it yet. If the RSI's signal is correct, we will most likely see an acceleration of the reversal in the upcoming days.</p></span></div>",

While the catalyst behind the rally might be unclear, Polygon’s (MATIC) bullish trend could be a part of its upcoming zkEVM Network update. As the launch draws near, investors have continued to increase in numbers pouring more funds into the asset. </p><p class=\"\">Polygon is a layer-2 scaling solution built on top of the Ethereum blockchain to improve the network’s scalability. The soon-to-be-launched zkEVM network update is just one of the plans the developers of the Polygon network have announced to enhance the layer-2 scaling solution. </p><p class=\"\">According to Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal’s recent tweet, the anticipated zkEVM comes soon as the mainnet launch now has an official date which is somewhere around the corner.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Polygon (MATIC) Surges Nearly 10% In 24 hours</strong></p><p class=\"\">Over the past 24 hours, MATIC has spiked in price by 8.6%, mirroring other altcoins’ bullish trend as the global cryptocurrency market capitalization still holds steady above the previously amassed $1 trillion mark. </p><p class=\"\">The past few weeks have seen a MATIC mark an upward rally movement, especially since the beginning of the year. MATIC has moved from the $0.75 price tag seen late last year to $1.09 at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the 1-day chart still indicates more rallies as there is still liquidity at the higher highs to be taken.</p><p class=\"\">Notably, MATIC is ranked the 10th most valuable cryptocurrency asset by market capitalization, according to data aggregators CoinGecko and Coinmarketcap. Polygon currently has a market cap of $9.7 billion, higher than Solana with $8.8 billion but below Dogecoin, which sits at $11.8 billion.</p><p class=\"\">Though MATIC has been climbing highs since the beginning of the year, it is still far from its all-time high of $2.92, seen in 2021. With the ongoing disbelief in the crypto market among investors, it is still uncertain whether the zkEVM will be a good enough catalyst to drive its value beyond or closer to its peak.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Polygon Network User Activity Plummets</strong></p><p class=\"\">Despite MATIC’s appreciation in value, the network user activity has recorded a decline in the number of interactions. Polygon’s number of daily users started the year positively moving from roughly 404,000 seen on January 1 to 696,00 users on January 6.</p><p class=\"\">However, today, the figure has declined more than 10%, dropping to approximately 399,000, according to data from PolygonScan. The reason behind the plummet is still unclear, as the network activity is expected to increase, given the network’s recent collaborations with multiple top companies. </p><p class=\"\">Last year, Facebook (Meta) added support for the Polygon network. In addition, the layer-2 scaling solution recently partnered with Mastercard to launch a Web3 accelerator program to bring budding musical artists into the spotlight by leveraging Web3 technology and other blockchain-based innovations.</p></span></div>",

The platform has closed down deposits and advised users to withdraw their funds.</p><p class=\"\">The crypto market witnessed projects suspending withdrawals and filing for bankruptcy in 2022. This eventually resulted in millions of users’ funds being stuck in the platforms due to illiquidity. But Friktion, a DeFi project on Solana, has voluntarily turned the lights off for good, allowing users to withdraw from the platform.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Friktion Bids Adieu to its Community </strong></p><p class=\"\">The project has announced to “sunset” its user platform. The team informed users to withdraw from the platform and also scrapped all withdrawal fees. Source: Discord screenshot</p><p class=\"\">The announcement of the closure of the platform will be made in parts. Currently, only the first part is out on Medium. The Discord community manager, C.M. Wulf, informed users that the second part of the announcement would shed more light on the platform’s closure. However, he briefly mentioned that with the operational costs being more than the yield, the team realized that the project could not be sustained for long.</p><p class=\"\">The community has shown their support on the Discord chat and wished the team luck. LuciusVorenus, a community member, says, “Just a quick note to say thanks to the Friktion team. It was a cool product, and I was excited for it and thought it would work out differently, I’m sure you did too.”</p><p class=\"\">However, some users have also demanded a refund on their NFT purchases.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>The Product Offerings </strong></p><p class=\"\">Friktion was primarily a portfolio management platform, which then moved on to lending services. It provided users with various return-generating strategies known as Volt.</p><p class=\"\">At its peak, Friktion had 20,000 wallets registered, passed $3 billion in trading volume, and had $150 million in Total Value Locked (TVL). Source: Friktion</p><p class=\"\">The project also launched “Lightning OG,” a collection of 2,222 NFTs currently trading on MagicEden at a floor price of roughly $5.</p><p class=\"\">As the project is shutting down permanently, its main operation is processing withdrawals. </p><p class=\"\">Got something to say about Friktion or anything else?
